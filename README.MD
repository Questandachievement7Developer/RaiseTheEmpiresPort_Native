> Single Script Archive is a single installation file that automates the installation of the server ( Same as a setup wizard in windows but custom built ). Now you don't even need to download the file, just copy paste the command below

## How to install ?
### Installing on Android using Termux
1. Install Termux and Puffin Browser from Play Store
2. Copy paste this command to Termux:
```
curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Questandachievement7Developer/RaiseTheEmpiresPort_Native/master/empiresservercontainer/devTool/TermuxAutoinstaller" | bash -
./empires-server-termux
bash
```
3. Wait until the installation is completed (and make sure your internet is stable)
4. After the empires-server is running, copy the link into the Puffin Browser

*Done!*
